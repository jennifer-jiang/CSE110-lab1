#### About Me
I'm a third year **Math-CS major** at UC San Diego, originally from the Bay Area. 

#### Fun Facts
1. I have a corgi named Winnie! [Picture of my corgi in a car](winniecar.jpg)
2. I enjoy playing a variety of online games with my friends, which I got more into after I built my first PC during quarantine. Some games include:
   - Valorant
   - Minecraft
   - Overcooked
3. I worked on developing various emoji features for Google Docs this past summer. Here's a [link](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/08/inline-emoji-insertion-Docs.html) to a Google Workspace blog that includes one of the features I developed.

As a programmer, I have experience in frontend and backend web development and Android app development.

> Java is my most familiar programming language.

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); 
    }
}
```
